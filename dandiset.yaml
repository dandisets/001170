description: This study explores odor-evoked activity representation in the olfactory
  bulb (OB) and how odor responses enable odor discrimination. Contrary to some previously
  cited theories that suggest a sparse representation, we hypothesize a more dense
  representation during odor presentation. A key question is how odors are reliably
  encoded in OB activity patterns, and how these patterns contribute to early odor
  processing. To address this problem, we recorded population level odor responses
  from the mouse OB with mesoscale two photon calcium imaging and applied machine
  learning techniques to suggest a model in which sparse coding is largely sufficient
  for olfaction, but redundant information may make odor coding more robust across
  different variables.
